## Key Principles of Web Design

### 1. **Usability**
Usability refers to how easy and intuitive it is for users to navigate and interact with the website. A website that is difficult to use will drive users away.

#### Key Aspects of Usability:
- **Navigation**: Easy to find menus, buttons, and links.
- **Responsiveness**: The design should adapt well to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that all users, including those with disabilities, can use the website effectively.

### 2. **Visual Design**
Visual design is about arranging text, images, and other elements in a way that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

#### Key Elements of Visual Design:
- **Contrast**: Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background for readability.
- **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent style, color scheme, and layout throughout the site.
- **Whitespace**: Proper use of empty space enhances readability and creates a clean design.

### 2. **Wireframing & Prototyping**

Wireframing and prototyping are essential steps to visualize the layout and interactivity of the website before moving to development.

#### Wireframe:
- **Definition**: A low-fidelity visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website.
- **Purpose**: It helps define the structure of each page, including the placement of text, images, buttons, and other content.
- **Tools for Wireframing**:
  - Figma
  - Balsamiq
  - Adobe XD

#### Prototype:
- **Definition**: A clickable, interactive version of the wireframe to demonstrate user interaction.
- **Purpose**: It allows stakeholders to test the website's functionality before development starts.
- **Tools for Prototyping**:
  - InVision
  - Marvel App
  - Axure RP

### 3. **Layout**
Layout refers to the way the elements are arranged on a webpage. The layout should be intuitive and should guide usersâ€™ attention to the most important content.

#### Common Layout Types:
- **F-layout**: The most common layout, where the content is placed in a top-left-to-bottom-right reading pattern.
- **Z-layout**: Ideal for websites with limited content and a call-to-action in the center of the page.

#### Example Layout:
```html
<header>
  <nav>Navigation Bar</nav>
</header>
<main>
  <section>Primary Content</section>
  <section>Secondary Content</section>
</main>
<footer>Footer Content</footer>
